              Are you doing anything on 6th May next year? I'm organising an event and need a passionate data scientist
              to tell it as it is! Let me know it you are interested, and what you would like to talk about - hopefully
              something technical and thought provoking.

              with the company.

            <p class="fragment">
              <b>Client:</b> Thanks! We don't really have time to use this model at the moment, as our churn rates are

              <b>Current me:</b> So what you really want is to reduce churn, because you assume that preventable churn is
              costing you $10M per year. Hence, you'd be willing to pay for a system that not only predicts churn, but
              also schedules the most effective interventions to prevent it based on the customer's personal
              circumstances.

            <h3>Pearl: Probability calculus isn't enough</h3>
            <blockquote class="full-width left">
              The explanation for Simpson's paradox should be clear to readers of this book, since we have taken great
              care in distinguishing <i>seeing</i> from <i>doing</i>. The conditioning operator in probability calculus
              stands for the evidential conditional "given that we see," whereas the do() operator was devised to
              represent the causal conditional "given that we do." Accordingly, the inequality P(E|C) > P(E|&not;C) is
              not a statement about C being a positive causal factor for E, properly written P(E|do(C)) > P(E|do(&not;C)),
              but rather about C being positive evidence for E, which may be due to spurious confounding factors that
              cause both C and E.

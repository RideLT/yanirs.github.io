              Are you doing anything on 6th May next year? I'm organising an event and need a passionate data scientist
              to tell it as it is! Let me know if you are interested, and what you would like to talk about - hopefully
              something technical and thought provoking.

              costing you $10M per year. Hence, you'd be willing to pay for a system that not only predicts churn, but
              also schedules the most effective interventions to prevent it based on the customer's personal
              circumstances.

            <blockquote data-fragment-index='0' class="full-width fragment">
              The explanation for Simpson's paradox should be clear to readers of this book, since we have taken great
              care in distinguishing <i>seeing</i> from <i>doing</i>. The conditioning operator in probability calculus
              stands for the evidential conditional "given that we see," whereas the do() operator was devised to
              represent the causal conditional "given that we do." Accordingly, the inequality P(E|C) > P(E|&not;C) is
              not a statement about C being a positive causal factor for E, properly written P(E|do(C)) > P(E|do(&not;C)),
              but rather about C being positive evidence for E, which may be due to spurious confounding factors that
              cause both C and E.

              There is simply no unified philosophical theory of what causes are, and no single foolproof computational
              method for finding them with absolute certainty. What makes this even more challenging is that, depending on
              one's definition of causality, different factors may be identified as causes in the same situation, and it
              may not be clear what the ground truth is.

              We know, from first principles, that any causal conclusion drawn from observational studies must rest on
              untested causal assumptions. Cartwright (1989) named this principle 'no causes in, no causes out,' which
              follows formally from the theory of equivalent models (Verma and Pearl, 1990); for any model yielding a
              conclusion C, one can construct a statistically equivalent model that refutes C and fits the data equally
              well.

              Our findings parallel those of previous work and show that endorsement of free-market
              economics predicted rejection of climate science. Endorsement of free markets also predicted the rejection
              of other established scientific findings, such as the facts that HIV causes AIDS and that smoking causes
              lung cancer. We additionally show that, above and beyond endorsement of free markets, endorsement of a
              cluster of conspiracy theories (e.g., that the Federal Bureau of Investigation killed Martin Luther King,
              Jr.) predicted rejection of climate science as well as other scientific findings. Our results provide
              empirical support for previous suggestions that conspiratorial thinking contributes to the rejection of
              science.

            to tell it as it is! Let me know it you are interested, and what you would like to talk about - hopefully
            something technical and thought provoking.

            with the company.

            <b>Client:</b> Thanks! We don't really have time to use this model at the moment, as our churn rates are
            actually pretty low. Let's talk again when this becomes a problem.

            <b>Current me:</b> Why do you need a model to predict churn? What are you going to do with it?

          p.fragment.center: i ...a few minutes later...

          p.fragment.
            <b>Current me:</b> So what you really want is to reduce churn, because you assume that preventable churn is
            costing you $10M per year. Hence, you'd be willing to pay for a system that not only predicts churn, but
            also schedules the most effective interventions to prevent it based on the customer's personal
            circumstances.
          p.fragment.

          p.fragment: i We always use a model, even if using it is worse than random
          p.fragment.indent Run away, even faster. Sounds like they're unlikely to see business value in data science.
          p.fragment: i We want to understand what's causing churn
          p.fragment.indent Be careful with your modelling, e.g., short tenure doesn't necessarily <b>cause</b> churn.

        section
          h3 Pearl: Probability calculus isn't enough

          blockquote.full-width.
            The explanation for Simpson's paradox should be clear to readers of this book, since we have taken great
            care in distinguishing <i>seeing</i> from <i>doing</i>. The conditioning operator in probability calculus
            stands for the evidential conditional "given that we see," whereas the do() operator was devised to
            represent the causal conditional "given that we do." Accordingly, the inequality P(E|C) > P(E|&not;C) is
            not a statement about C being a positive causal factor for E, properly written P(E|do(C)) > P(E|do(&not;C)),
            but rather about C being positive evidence for E, which may be due to spurious confounding factors that
            cause both C and E.

        section
          h3 Causal assumptions are essential

          p.fragment(data-fragment-index=0) <b>Key assumption:</b> Males tend to use the drug more (F &rarr; C)
          p.indent.fragment(data-fragment-index=0).
            Condition on the confounding variable F: Follow the gender-specific measures and never prescribe C

          p.fragment(data-fragment-index=1).
            <b>Different scenario:</b> F is high blood pressure, and the drug may raise blood pressure (C &rarr; F)
          p.indent.fragment(data-fragment-index=1).
            No point conditioning on F: Follow the overall measures and always prescribe C

        section
          h3 One last scenario

          p.fragment(data-fragment-index=0).
            F is brown eye colour, and we can't assume it affects drug selection, or is affected by it
          p.indent.fragment(data-fragment-index=0).
            No point conditioning on F: Follow the overall measures and always prescribe C

          p.fragment(data-fragment-index=1).
            <b>Generally:</b> The decision whether to use F to predict E can't only depend on the data &ndash; the data
            may lie

          h3 Cause of frustration #1:<br>No single definition

          blockquote.full-width.
            There is simply no unified philosophical theory of what causes are, and no single foolproof computational
            method for finding them with absolute certainty. What makes this even more challenging is that, depending on
            one's definition of causality, different factors may be identified as causes in the same situation, and it
            may not be clear what the ground truth is.

        section
          h3 Cause of frustration #2:<br>Need for untested assumptions

          blockquote.full-width.
            We know, from first principles, that any causal conclusion drawn from observational studies must rest on
            untested causal assumptions. Cartwright (1989) named this principle 'no causes in, no causes out,' which
            follows formally from the theory of equivalent models (Verma and Pearl, 1990); for any model yielding a
            conclusion C, one can construct a statistically equivalent model that refutes C and fits the data equally
            well.

        section
          h3 Cause of frustration #3:<br>Unreasonable people

          blockquote.full-width.
            Our findings parallel those of previous work and show that endorsement of free-market
            economics predicted rejection of climate science. Endorsement of free markets also predicted the rejection
            of other established scientific findings, such as the facts that HIV causes AIDS and that smoking causes
            lung cancer. We additionally show that, above and beyond endorsement of free markets, endorsement of a
            cluster of conspiracy theories (e.g., that the Federal Bureau of Investigation killed Martin Luther King,
            Jr.) predicted rejection of climate science as well as other scientific findings. Our results provide
            empirical support for previous suggestions that conspiratorial thinking contributes to the rejection of
            science.

            Now he's a corporate lawyer working in a prominent New York firm. He was the first to admit that his job was

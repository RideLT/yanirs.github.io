            Are you doing anything on 6th May next year? I'm organising an event and need a passionate data scientist
            to tell it as it is! Let me know it you are interested, and what you would like to talk about - hopefully
            something technical and thought provoking.

          p.fragment.
            <b>Younger me:</b> Sure, I'll plow through your data and use deep learning to build the best model ever!
            It's going to be awesome!

          p.fragment.center: i ...a few weeks later...

          p.fragment.
            <b>Younger me:</b> The model is ready! It's super-accurate, with the most predictive feature being tenure
            with the company.
          p.fragment.
            <b>Client:</b> Thanks! We don't really have time to use this model at the moment, as our churn rates are
            actually pretty low. Let's talk again when this becomes a problem.

        section
          h3 Better ask why

          p.fragment.
            <b>Client:</b> I need a model to predict churn.
          p.fragment.
            <b>Current me:</b> Why do you need a model to predict churn? What are you going to do with it?

          p.fragment.center: i ...a few minutes later...

          p.fragment.
            <b>Current me:</b> So what you really want is to reduce churn, because you assume that preventable churn is
            costing you $10M per year. Hence, you'd be willing to pay for a system that not only predicts churn, but
            also schedules the most effective interventions to prevent it based on the customer's personal
            circumstances.
          p.fragment.
            <b>Client:</b> Correct! Please build me this magical system!

        section
          h3 Possible answers to <i>why do you need a model?</i>

          p.fragment: i It'll look good on my performance review
          p.fragment.indent Run away!
          p.fragment: i We always use a model, even if using it is worse than random
          p.fragment.indent Run away, even faster. Sounds like they're unlikely to see business value in data science.
          p.fragment: i We want to understand what's causing churn
          p.fragment.indent Be careful with your modelling, e.g., short tenure doesn't necessarily <b>cause</b> churn.

        section
          h3 Pearl: Probability calculus isn't enough

          blockquote.full-width.left.
            The explanation for Simpson's paradox should be clear to readers of this book, since we have taken great
            care in distinguishing <i>seeing</i> from <i>doing</i>. The conditioning operator in probability calculus
            stands for the evidential conditional "given that we see," whereas the do() operator was devised to
            represent the causal conditional "given that we do." Accordingly, the inequality P(E|C) > P(E|&not;C) is
            not a statement about C being a positive causal factor for E, properly written P(E|do(C)) > P(E|do(&not;C)),
            but rather about C being positive evidence for E, which may be due to spurious confounding factors that
            cause both C and E.

        section
          h3 Causal assumptions are essential

          p.fragment(data-fragment-index=0) <b>Key assumption:</b> Males tend to use the drug more (&not;F &rarr; C)
          p.indent.fragment(data-fragment-index=0).
            Condition on the confounding variable F: Follow the gender-specific measures and never prescribe C

          img.fragment(data-fragment-index=1, src="img/simpsons-paradox-causal-assumptions.png")

          p.fragment(data-fragment-index=1).
            <b>Different scenario:</b> F is high blood pressure, and the drug may raise blood pressure (C &rarr; F)
          p.indent.fragment(data-fragment-index=1).
            No point conditioning on F: Follow the overall measures and always prescribe C

          //- Not much time, but mention Granger, Pearl, Kleinberg

        section

          //- Mention Hill as a way of finding them

        section
          h3 Causal frustrations

          //- Causal assumptions means you need to convince people
          //- Many definitions exist
          //- Methods are limited (I've yet to use this stuff in practice
          //- Changing deeply-held beliefs is near-impossible (UQ course, that article from the causality post)
          //- way more important and foundational than a lot of the crap taught in schools - should be part of primary school curriculum

          blockquote.full-width.left.
            I would not presume to tell someone who is convinced they are making a meaningful contribution to the world
            that, really, they are not. But what about those people who are themselves convinced their jobs are
            meaningless? Not long ago I got back in touch with a school friend who I hadn't seen since I was 12.
            [...]
            Now he's a corporate lawyer working in a prominent New York firm. He was the first to admit that his job was
            utterly meaningless, contributed nothing to the world, and, in his own estimation, should not really exist.

                People who sell their souls for the promise of a secure job and a secure salary are spat out as soon as
                they become dispensable. The more loyal to an institution you are, the more exploitable, and ultimately
                expendable, you become.
